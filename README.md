jQuery helps to
reduce the JavaScript code.
That means we have to
write very less code
compared to the JavaScript
code.



jQuery is “write less, do more”
JavaScript library.
jQuery also makes web applications
load a lot faster than JavaScript.


steps:
======
● Browser sends an HTTP
request.

● Server responds and sends
back the requested HTML file.

● Browser begins to render
HTML.

● Browser then sends additional
requests for objects present in
the HTML file (CSS files,
images, JavaScript, etc.).

The faster all steps are completed, the
faster the web page will be loaded!
