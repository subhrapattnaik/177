jQuery helps to
reduce the JavaScript code.
That means we have to
write very less code
compared to the JavaScript
code.



jQuery is “write less, do more”
JavaScript library.
jQuery also makes web applications
load a lot faster than JavaScript.


steps:
======
● Browser sends an HTTP
request.

● Server responds and sends
back the requested HTML file.

● Browser begins to render
HTML.

● Browser then sends additional
requests for objects present in
the HTML file (CSS files,
images, JavaScript, etc.).

The faster all steps are completed, the
faster the web page will be loaded!

millions of people using the
browser at the same time, how is this
possible for Google to give such fast
results?

Well the Google Chrome browser is
built on one of the very powerful

technologies used in the web
application, that is, AJAX.
AJAX is Asynchronous JavaScript and
XML.
In simple terms, this technique helps
to load/update the specific portion of
the page, instead of loading the whole
page again and again.

For example, in our Mad Libs game,
when we click on the Submit button
the result should be updated without
reloading the page again!

That means only the result section
should be updated!

lets learn
how to use the jQuery ajax() method to
show the score when the user clicks
on the submit button for a particular
Mad Libs story.
